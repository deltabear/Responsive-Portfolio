      <p>Web developer specializing in front end development. Having grown up technology literate, I was inevitably drawn to the building blocks that make technology possible. </p>
      <p>I find that designing user interfaces, and other aspects of coding benefit from the ability to look at problems creatively for solutions through HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and associated libraries such as Bootstrap and JQuery.</p>
      <p>Committed to tech that is accessible, humanitarian and socially conscious. My technical expertise and emotional intelligence make me a unique and valuable team member who would add efficiency to your team.</p>
